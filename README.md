# Guess-the-Number-with-Python

This project is a number guessing game in Python that demonstrates three ways to guess a random number. The first method is a user guessing game, where the program picks a random number, and the user has a limited number of tries to guess it, with hints to guess higher or lower. The second method is a linear search, where the program tries to guess the number by checking each possibility one by one until it either finds the answer or runs out of tries. The third method uses a faster technique called binary search, where the program cuts the range of numbers in half each time, quickly narrowing down to the correct answer. This project shows different ways to solve the same problem and uses basic programming concepts like loops and decision-making.
